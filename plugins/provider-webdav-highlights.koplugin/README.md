# KOReader WebDAV Highlights Exporter
This script expands the existing exporter options to allow export of your highlights in markdown format to a WebDAV target.

### Instructions
- Clone the repository into your plugins folder (the path, depending on your platform, should look something like /koreader/plugins/provider-webdav-highlights.plugin)
- In the settings menu, click Export Highlights -> Choose formats and services -> WebDAV (Markdown) -> Configure WebDAV and enter your credentials.
- Enable the exporter

This plugin makes use of relatively recent features of KOReader, allowing plugins to act of providers for other plugins. If the new export target does not appear, make sure you are using a recent version of KOReader.
